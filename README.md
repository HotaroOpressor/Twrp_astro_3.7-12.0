•(WARNING)

This device uses Dynamic Partitions
This means that TWRP will not allow modifications to any of the partitions that make up the Super partition on the stock ROM. All backups and restores will include the full Super partition rather than the individual dynamic partitions.
In order to flash the individual partitions, you will have to boot into fastbootd.
